- We had a meeting to discuss application requirements, ideas and wishes.
- We decided to use current logo and style
- We discussed the main idea of the application and had 3 ideas:
  
  1. Map positioning with QR-codes/April tags. You scan tag and are being located on the map
  2. Map visualisation right on the tag. Interactive.
  3. Animation with a Dinosaur/User that is running to a point of interest/exit
- We decided to use

  1. Next.js
  2. AR.js
